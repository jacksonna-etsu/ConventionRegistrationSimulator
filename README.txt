This is a convention registration simulator that demonstrates the use of
Priority Queue Data Structures. When running the program, the default input
parameters should produce a good example of the program's usage. This program
simulates a convention registration. People come into the convention.
After enterting the convention they find a registration booth to buy
tickets. Each booth has a waiting line. When the program is running, each
line is represented with asterisks. During thesimulation, these lines will
grow longer or shrink smaller depending on the simulated time of day. A line
grows when a new person enters the convention and chooses the shortest line.
A line shrinks when a person is done buying their tickets and enters the
convention.
